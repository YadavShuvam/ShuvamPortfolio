    'firstParagraph': 'My journey into networking began with a simple question: <em>How do computers communicate?</em> As a kid, I was fascinated by the idea that devices could connect and share information across the globe. This curiosity led me to tinker with routers, set up small home networks, and eventually pursue a career in network engineering. During my early academic years, I immersed myself in learning the fundamentals of computer networks, from IP addressing to routing protocols. I realized that networking wasn’t just about cables and devices—it was about building the invisible highways that power our digital world.',

I specialize in <em>cloud networking and cybersecurity</em>, and I’ve had the privilege of working on projects like <em>migrating a hospital’s entire network to a hybrid cloud environment, ensuring HIPAA compliance, and deploying a secure SD-WAN solution across 20+ locations for a retail chain</em>. What drives me is the challenge of solving complex problems and ensuring that networks are not only efficient but also secure and scalable.',
